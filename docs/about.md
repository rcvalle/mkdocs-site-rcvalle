Hello,

I'm an Information Security Engineer at Google, working with vulnerability
research and mitigations development. I'm also an [early developer and longtime
contributor][1] of Metasploit, [member of the Compiler team][2], and [Lead of
the Exploit Mitigations Project Group][3] of the Rust compiler.

Previously, I worked as a Principal Software Engineer at Blizzard, member of
the Game Security Engineering Team, working embedded with the game development
teams, where I worked on games such as Diablo, StarCraft, WarCraft, and World
of Warcraft.

Before working professionally with information security, I participated in some
subcommunities/subcultures of [The Scene][4], and also co-founded [one of the
earliest vulnerability research groups in Brazil][5].

Feel free to reach out to me on [Mastodon][6] or [X][7]. I'm always happy to
chat about vulnerability research, exploit mitigations, or anything related to
Information Security.
