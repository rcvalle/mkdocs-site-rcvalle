- description: This article discusses buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Linux running
    on Power/Cell Broadband Engine Architecture processor-based servers. All examples
    presented on this article were developed and executed on an IBM BladeCenter JS22
    Express server, a IBM BladeCenter QS21 server, and a Sony Playstation 3, running
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update 7. Previous knowledge of buffer overflows is
    required.
