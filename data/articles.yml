- description: As the industry continues to explore Rust adoption, cross-language
    attacks in mixed-language binaries (also known as “mixed binaries”), and
    critically the absence of support for forward-edge control flow protection in
    the Rust compiler, are a major security concern when gradually migrating from C
    and C++ to Rust, and when C or C++ and Rust -compiled code share the same
    virtual address space.

    In this article I share the results of working with the Rust community to add
    LLVM CFI and cross-language LLVM CFI (and LLVM KCFI and cross-language LLVM
    KCFI) to the Rust compiler as part of the work in the upstream Rust Exploit
    Mitigations Project Group.

    on Power/Cell Broadband Engine Architecture processor-based servers. All examples
    presented on this article were developed and executed on an IBM BladeCenter JS22
    Express server, a IBM BladeCenter QS21 server, and a Sony Playstation 3, running
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update 7. Previous knowledge of buffer overflows is
    required.
