- description: This module exploits a logic error in OpenSSL by impersonating the
    server and sending a specially-crafted chain of certificates, resulting in certain
    checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed on the client, allowing it to
    use a valid leaf certificate as a CA certificate to sign a fake certificate. The
    SSL/TLS session is then proxied to the server allowing the session to continue
    normally and application data transmitted between the peers to be saved. The valid
    leaf certificate must not contain the keyUsage extension or it must have at least
    the keyCertSign bit set (see X509_check_issued function in crypto/x509v3/v3_purp.c);
    otherwise; X509_verify_cert fails with X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY.
    This module requires an active man-in-the-middle attack.

- description: This module exploits an incomplete internal state distinction in Java
    Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) by impersonating the server and finishing the handshake
    before the peers have authenticated themselves and instantiated negotiated security
    parameters, resulting in a plaintext SSL/TLS session with the client. This plaintext
    SSL/TLS session is then proxied to the server using a second SSL/TLS session from
    the proxy to the server (or an alternate fake server) allowing the session to
    continue normally and plaintext application data transmitted between the peers
    to be saved. This module requires an active man-in-the-middle attack.

    continues to run, even if there are no active requests.
